Overview
---
This project uses deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs from the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). 

The project features:
* Exporatory display of the input data
* Design, training and testing of the model architecture using TensorFlow
* Use of the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyzing the softmax probabilities of the new images
